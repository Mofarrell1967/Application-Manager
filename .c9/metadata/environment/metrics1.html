If you work for one of our corporate customers, please ask your employer – they’ll ask for this on your behalf. It will normally take us up to one month to get back to you but could take longer (up to a further two","              months) if it’s a complicated request or we get a lot of requests at once. We’ll reply electronically unless you ask us to send the information by post.</p>","        </div>","        <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-danger\" data-dismiss=\"modal\">Close</button>","      </div>","    </div>","  </div>","","","","  <!-- Footer Modal End -->","","","","  <!-- Page Footer Start -->","","","  <footer class=\"container-fluid footer text-center\">","","    <div class=\"row\">","      <div class=\"col-sm-4\">","        <h5 class=\"uppercase general-sub\">BT Legal Notice & Privacy Policy</h5>","        <p class=\"inline-block\">","          Click to view.","          <button class=\"btn btn-sm btn--cta btn--red\" data-toggle=\"modal\" data-target=\"#PPModal\">Open</button></p>","      </div>","      <div class=\"d-none d-sm-block col-sm-4\">","        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://btireland.com/\"><img src=\"assets/images/bt.jpg\" class=\"rounded-circle mr-3\" height=50 width=70 alt=\"No Image available/\"></a>","      </div>","      <div class=\"col-sm-4\">","        <h5 class=\"uppercase general-sub\">BT Social Links</h5>","        <ul class=\"list-inline sm-links\">","          <li class=\"list-inline-item\">","            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/btinireland\">","                            <i class=\"fa fa-twitter\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>","                            <span class=\"sr-only\">Twitter</span></a>","          </li>","          <li class=\"list-inline-item\">","            <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bt-ireland\">","                            <i class=\"fa fa-linkedin\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>","                            <span class=\"sr-only\">LinkedIn</span> </a>","          </li>","        </ul>","      </div>","    </div>","  </footer>","","  <!-- Page Footer End -->","","","  <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>","  <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>","  <script src=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-ChfqqxuZUCnJSK3+MXmPNIyE6ZbWh2IMqE241rYiqJxyMiZ6OW/JmZQ5stwEULTy\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>","","","</body>","","</html>",""],"id":1}],[{"start":{"row":10,"column":47},"end":{"row":10,"column":48},"action":"remove","lines":["1"],"id":2},{"start":{"row":10,"column":47},"end":{"row":10,"column":48},"action":"remove","lines":["."]}],[{"start":{"row":270,"column":1},"end":{"row":270,"column":33},"action":"remove","lines":[" <div class=\"col about-example\">"],"id":3}],[{"start":{"row":287,"column":4},"end":{"row":287,"column":35},"action":"remove","lines":["<div class=\"col about-example\">"],"id":4}],[{"start":{"row":287,"column":4},"end":{"row":287,"column":36},"action":"insert","lines":[" <div class=\"col about-example\">"],"id":5}],[{"start":{"row":270,"column":1},"end":{"row":270,"column":33},"action":"insert","lines":[" <div class=\"col about-example\">"],"id":6}],[{"start":{"row":165,"column":2},"end":{"row":167,"column":26},"action":"remove","lines":["<div class=\"col about-header\">","    <div class=\"row\">","      <div class=\"col-lg\">"],"id":7},{"start":{"row":165,"column":2},"end":{"row":167,"column":26},"action":"insert","lines":["<div class=\"col about-example\">","    <div class=\"row\">","      <div class=\"col-lg\">"]}],[{"start":{"row":97,"column":4},"end":{"row":99,"column":26},"action":"remove","lines":["<div class=\"col about-header\">","    <div class=\"row\">","      <div class=\"col-lg\">"],"id":8},{"start":{"row":97,"column":4},"end":{"row":99,"column":26},"action":"insert","lines":["<div class=\"col about-example\">","    <div class=\"row\">","      <div class=\"col-lg\">"]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":600,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":99,"column":26},"end":{"row":99,"column":26},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":{"row":92,"state":"start","mode":"ace/mode/html"}},"timestamp":1560685642673,"hash":"74129a1ef88d96b4dd0f5b8e1bb26e98e5cf244c"}
