                                <p>IN THE beginning there were 14 nations and 245 athletes, all of them male. There were nine sports, 43 medals to be won, and Baron de Coubertin was already worried that money was corrupting the whole thing. The Olympics,
                                    more than any other sporting event, has always known the price of everything and the value of nothing, which is probably why they still don’t give out a single penny in prizemoney – and why some people will always count
                                    success on the medal table. So if, from this morning, our first and last target in London over these next two weeks is to get someone on the podium, watch the Tricolour being run up the flagpole, hear the drowned-out
                                    anthem, then at least we’re not alone. They’re saying the same thing this morning, all over the world, from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. Show us the medals! For those taking part this must get a little tiresome, discouraging
                                    even: take the majority of the 66 Irish competitors in London, show them a place in their finals, or a placing at all, and they’ll still come home singing. On the track and field, in particular, there may not be even
                                    a single Irish finalist, beyond those running in straight finals. Forget about any of them showing us a medal – and perhaps more than any other recent Olympics, no one is expecting a medal either. Four years ago, in
                                    Beijing, all the talk was of “managing expectations”, but there’ll always be a difficulty separating perception from reality. That goes for the entire Olympic ideal. Citius, Altius, Fortius? – Nothing to do with the
                                    Olympics, but the motto of a French Dominican monk, Henri Didon. It’s not the winning but the taking part? – Not the words of De Coubertin, but of Bishop Ethelbert Talbot, from Pennsylvania, spoken during his sermon
                                    at the Olympic service in St Paul’s Cathedral, on the eve of the first London Games in 1908. These days there’s not a country in the world that believes it’s about the taking part, or ever did, which is why they invest
                                    so heavily in winning medals. Beijing demonstrated that more than any other Olympics, when, in their quest to win as much as possible, China’s investment ran into the billions. It worked, as in the end they topped the
                                    medal table for the first time in their Olympic history, winning exactly 100 medals, 51 of them lacquered in gold. It was calculated afterwards that each of those 100 medals had cost China an investment of around €40
                                    million. You do the maths.
