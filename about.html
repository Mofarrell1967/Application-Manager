                                                 <p>The ROA products capture real-time network telemetry from the devices in IP/MPLS networks as well as from network orchestrators and SDN controllers. All routing events are captured by passively monitoring the
                                                IGP and BGP routing protocols to maintain an always-current Layer 3 topology model. Traffic flow records and performance metrics are collected and mapped to the routing data to provide path-aware visibility
                                                into service delivery.</p>
                                            <p>With the Blue Planet ROA products, operations teams are empowered to triage problems faster and troubleshoot many that previously had to be escalated to level 2/3 engineering staff.</p>
                                            <h6 class="font-italic">Real – Time & Historical Analytics</h6>
                                            <p>Blue Planet ROA records routing telemetry in real time to maintain current and historical models of the network control plane. Using these models, powerful analytics help operations teams detect, diagnose and
                                                adapt quickly to unforeseen events in the network. Engineering and NOC teams gain unmatched visibility into control plane issues that degrade services, such as a link failure that causes congestion or a
