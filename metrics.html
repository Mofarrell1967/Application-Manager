                        <p>CA PM and BP ROA provide a vast suite of pre-set reports and dashboards for use out-of-the-box.</p>

                                <h5>Dashboards</h5>
                                <p>Dashboards contain sets of views that let you see the polled data as meaningful information. You can also generate reports from dashboards. In addition to created custom dashboards, 
                                several out-of-the-box dashboards are available. When you log in, all dashboards that are assigned to your user account are accessible. Out-of-the-box dashboards provide data immediately
                                after you run discovery and begin collecting metrics from your environment.  </p>
                                <p>When you register a new data source, you can use the out-of-the-box dashboards and views that are associated with it. You can edit dashboards, and can save the changes to your own user account.
                                CA Performance Management includes two categories of pages:</p>
                                <h5>Dashboard Pages</h5>
                                <p>Provide high-level information, such as average performance of monitored items in a group. Dashboards often provide a drill-down path to more detailed, related pages from a selected context. 
                                The dashboards provide views for different users across your organization. Use these dashboards as a starting point to create your own dashboard.</p>
                                <h5>Context Pages</h5>
                                <p>Provide focused performance and status data that is scoped to a specific item, such as a single router or server. These pages are available as drill-down links or tabs from dashboard pages.</p>

                                <p>All dashboards can be customized with different set of views, context, and layouts. Custom dashboards can be used to troubleshoot issues or long term to monitor categories of items.</p>

                                <p>The dashboard context filters the data appears in views on the dashboard. When you select a group for a standard dashboard, you apply a filter to all views on the page. When you select a group context, items from all subgroups
                                    that are available to you appear in views on the dashboard. However, the same subgroups might not appear on the Items tab in Group administration.</p>
                                <h5> On-Demand Reports</h5>
                                <p>On-Demand reports retrieve data sets from specific sets of items or groups without building a dashboard. To view the same data in different ways, change the view type of the report.</p>
                                <p>You can add On-Demand reports to group and device context pages. For group context pages, the reports use the selected group as the context for the view. For device context pages, the reports use the device as the context.</p>
