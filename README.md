A Code Institute Project in Centric Front End Website Development

*Author :* Michael O'Farrell

*Website Summary :* 

The website are pages for 2 reporting systems utilised by my employers and the
employees. The aim of the site is to provide information, updates, access and examples of the systems and their use in 
daily business.

The design goal was to provide a simple and central area for users to access all the required and relevant information
for the systems.

The colours, fonts and basic layouts are in keeping with the structure employed by the company with additional
styles and formats utilised to provide the institute with examples of my knowledge and abilities.
